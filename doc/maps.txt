A map will manually be made inside a txt file.
This txt file will be parsed into a two-d array.
The items in this array will be positioned automagically.

Map example:

xxxxx
xsoxx
xxooo
xxoxx
xxexx

o - path
x - wall
s - start
e - end
(later on we will add traps, keys and doors)

We will use a for loop to go over each character in the script and depending on the type push it into an array.
