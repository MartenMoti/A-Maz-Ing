A map will manually be made inside a txt file.
This txt file will be parsed into a 2D array.
The items in this array will be positioned automagically.

Map example:

S.xxx
x..xE
xx.x.
...x.
xx...

. - path
x - wall
S - start
E - end
(later on we will add traps, keys and doors)

We will use a for loop to go over each character in the script and depending on the type put it in a grid.
